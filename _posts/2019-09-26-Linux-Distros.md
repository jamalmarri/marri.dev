Over the past year, I began my dive into the wonderful world of Linux Distro Hopping.

<!--more-->

It all began with my first encounter with an Ubuntu lab computer at WWU. Before this, Windows was
always my go-to operating system. I grew up on it afterall, and it's just so easy to use. But I had
always craved more. I'd heard rumors of a different world of computing, one where no one was
limited by paid features, or a severe lack of customization. I didn't have as much control over
Windows as I would have liked. This new world, open source software, was fascinating to me. What
better way to jump in than start at the system level?

I began doing research, not only on which Linux distro I wanted, but what I wanted to run it on. My
main computer setup is primarily for playing games, and although Linux gaming has made leaps and
bounds in recent years, there were still many games that I didn't want to lose in the switch. I
ended buying a nice HP laptop from Best Buy, to become my daily driver for Linux. As for my first
disto? I wanted something approachable, but still customizable. Ubuntu was one of my first
considerations, given its incredible ease of use and huge community, but it still wasn't quite
perfect. Then I found Linux Mint.

Mint is based off of Ubuntu, and is fairly similar under the hood, but it offered me something I
fell in love with at first sight: Cinnamon. The Cinnamon desktop environment, although available on
other distros, was just perfect for me on Mint. The default theme, the icons, the gnome terminal,
the customizability. It was quick and easy to use to top it all off. Yes, Mint was the one. To this
day, even after getting adventurous with many other distros like Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, Arch, and
Manjaro, I still use Linux Mint as my daily driver. It's just perfect for my needs, and I just love
how Cinnamon looks and feels.

To anyone who hasn't made the jump to Linux yet, I highly recommend Linux Mint as a gateway distro
to the better side of computing.
